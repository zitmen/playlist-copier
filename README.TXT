Welcome to Playlist Copier!

This is a simple [C#.NET] utility for copying your music organized in a playlist 
to another location as a batch, for example to your mp3 player.



This is obviously pretty simple app, so there are no dependencies. Just open either
solution file or project file in VisualStudio and build it ;-)

I was building it in Visual Studio 2010 Professional.


Hope you find this app occasionaly useful as I do.
